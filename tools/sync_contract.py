"""Copy contract/ into every box's protos/, or check that it is already there.

Boxes keep their own protos/ so a box directory stays self-contained: copy it
anywhere and it builds. But the copy is GENERATED, never edited - this script
writes it and CI runs `--check` to fail any PR where one has drifted.

That matters more than it looks. In the 11-box VisionIST repo this registry was
split out of, pipeline.proto had already forked into three variants. They were
cosmetic (same field numbers, same wire format) and nobody noticed - which is
the point. The next fork would not have been cosmetic, and would have surfaced
as an unexplainable decode error in somebody else's fleet.
